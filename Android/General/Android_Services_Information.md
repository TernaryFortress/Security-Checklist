This is a list of android services, and what they (actually) do.

# Work Setup - com.android.managedprovisioning
This is for activating the Work Profile(s) on your device.

# com.samsung.euicc
E-sim setup

# com.sec.android.daemonapp
Weather app. Some phones crash if you disable this via adb, but it can be disabled through the interface just fine.
This one seems to be repurposed from a different application earlier in Android's lifespan.

# com.google.android.cellbroadcastreceiver
Emergency services (weather alerts, amber alerts, etc)

# com.google.android.overlay.gmsconfig.asi, com.google.android.overlay.gmsconfig.geotz
Anything "gms" is Google Services.
