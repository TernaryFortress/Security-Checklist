# Security-Checklist

This is just a blueprint. I am not a cyber-security professional, just someone who had to tunnel their way out of Hacker-Hell, and who has realized that there is not a distilled guide for doing so. If you ARE a cybersecurity professional, I would be interested in help building and maintaining this page.

This repository is designed to serve as a rolling-update security checklist for closing the holes that big-tech's data-whoring practices open up.

We wish to do our best to ensure that only necessary adjustments are made, and to maximize usability of the end-user's devices.

# Why "TernaryFortress"

The name is inspired by quantum mechanics. In information theory, a qubit (quantum bit) is a base-3 bit.

In a future where computation is exploding in power, and where AI is racing to unrivalled levels of precision and complexity, we need both strong regulations *and* strong defenses.

Although still a work in progress, we intend for this to ultimately be a one-stop-shop for comprehensive information on data privacy and anonymity online.

# State-of-Play

Insofar as my own perspective is concerned, the internet as we knew it is dead. Chatbots produce much of the content that you see, and they are being controlled by people who prioritize profit and control over our collective well-being. Let's all do our best to engage with each other in the real world, to forge real friendships and social bonds, create lasting and impactful communities, and get back to doing what we do best: Being human beings together.

# Required Domain Knowledge

**BIOS** - This is the software that your motherboard/logic board runs before initializing the operating system.

**Operating System** - This is the software that you interact directly with 99.9% of the time. You'll likely be using iOS, Windows, or Linux.

**Security Key** - Security Keys are a *password replacement* technology, and are quickly becoming the norm for enterprise security. Ubuntu even allows you to replace your password with a security key using the libpam-u2f library. Please backup any important files prior to attempting this, as you may get locked out of your system.
