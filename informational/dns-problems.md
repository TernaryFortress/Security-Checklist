Weirdly, I have noticed that some vendors do not have DNS information for critical government services.

Notably, Cloudflare DNS and Google DNS have had strange holes lately that shouldn't exist.

Quad9 and NextDns are both alternative DNS providers that may be able to help if these enterprise options fail. Ideally, you'd use a browser that suppors DNS-Over-HTTPS (DOH) or DNS-Over-TLS (DOT, aka Private DNS on Android) to use these providers.

We advise switching back to your normal Enterprise providers when you are finished.
